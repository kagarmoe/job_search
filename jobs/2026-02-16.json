However, none of the postings surfaced were published within the last 24 hours that meet *all* the criteria.\n\nHere’s what I found:\n\nFrom **Wellfound.com**:\n\n- **Technical Writer – Data Analytics at Metabase**  \n  Posted **2 weeks ago**, fully remote, startup (Series B growth stage) in analytics/data engineering; emphasizes docs-as-code, working with engineers, API/SDK documentation as *nice to have*. ([wellfound.com](https://wellfound.com/jobs/3813490-technical-writer-data-analytics?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Lead Technical Writer & Documentation Engineer at Source**  \n  Posted **3 months ago**, remote (including Seattle-friendly regions), startup in developer infrastructure, with strong emphasis on infrastructure, docs-as-code, working directly with engineers, and developer-facing documentation. However, **not within last 24 hours**. ([wellfound.com](https://wellfound.com/jobs/3543143-lead-technical-writer-documentation-engineer?utm_source=openai))\n\nFrom **BuiltIn.com**:\n\nNo relevant new postings within the last 24 hours—the available roles were either unrelated or posted much earlier (e.g., removed, non-technical-writing roles, or outside your specified domains). ([builtin.com](https://builtin.com/salaries/us/remote/technical-writer?utm_source=openai))\n\nGiven that **no postings match all your criteria and appear to have been posted within the past day**, I must conclude:\n\n**no new job posts in the last 24 hours**\n\nIf you'd like, I can continue monitoring—say, expand the window to the past week—or adjust filters (e.g., include Seed-funded startups, or allow slightly older postings). Just let me know how you'd like to proceed!",
