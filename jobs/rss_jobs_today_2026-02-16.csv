The people here at Apple don’t just build products — we craft the kind of wonder that’s revolutionized entire industries. It’s the diversity of those people and their ideas that inspires the innovation that runs through everything we do, from amazing technology to industry-leading environmental efforts. Join Apple, and help us leave the world better than we found it.<br /><br />The Applications team is looking for a technical writer to work on software specifications and user interface copy for Apple Creator Studio.<br /><br /><strong>Description<br /><br /></strong>This is a truly unique technical writing role, at Apple and in the industry. You won’t be writing about apps and features after they’ve been built. By doing a combination of spec writing and UX writing, you will help shape what we build, and play a key role in taking apps and features from the conceptual stages through development and testing.<br /><br />You will gather information about how apps should behave from Design, Product Management, Engineering, and other stakeholders. Then, you’ll distill that information into clear, understandable specifications that allow Engineering and QA to build and test world-class apps and features. These specifications capture use cases, edge cases, and functional requirements, and they are an indispensable part of the software development process.<br /><br />In addition to writing specs for internal audiences, you will write user interface copy that will be read by millions of people on their Apple devices. You will be responsible for crafting clear, concise, user-friendly copy, workshopping that copy with a cross-functional team, and occasionally presenting your proposed copy to senior executives.<br /><br /><strong>Minimum Qualifications<br /><br /></strong><ul><li>At least 1 year of software-related technical writing experience. </li><li>Be able to understand and document complex apps available on multiple platforms, including Mac, iPad, and iPhone. </li><li>Experience gathering requirements and other information from stakeholders, and translating that information into documentation. </li><li>Be able to think through complex use cases, and have a knack for uncovering use cases and edge cases that others haven’t thought of. </li><li>Demonstrate an ability to write structured, detailed specs based on the information you’ve gathered and the use cases you’ve thought of. </li><li>Excellent composition and grammar skills, and experience adapting your writing to adhere to a style guide. </li><li>Meticulous note-taking and organizational skills. Each day will bring new information about a wide variety of topics that you must be able to capture and organize, to write about later. </li><li>Experience presenting your work to large audiences, or openness to doing so. You will lead documentation review meetings where you present specifications and UX copy proposals to audiences of 5–50 people, including senior executives. </li><li>Ability to create and follow a documentation schedule. You must be able to accurately estimate how long it will take to reach milestones, meet the deadlines you set for yourself, and communicate changes well in advance, should deadlines need to change. </li><li>Understand the software development life cycle.</li><li>Work with minimal direction toward predetermined goals, and be able to quickly become proficient with new tools and apps.</li><li>Independently anticipate and resolve problems in a fast-paced environment.</li><li>BS/BA degree required in Technical Writing, Professional Writing, English, Communication, Computer Science, Engineering, Journalism, or other related field. </li><li>Love technical writing!<br /><br /></li></ul><strong>Preferred Qualifications<br /><br /></strong><ul><li>Experience writing use cases, requirements specifications, or user flows.</li><li>Experience writing copy for user interfaces (UX writing). </li><li>Experience working on or writing about subscription-based apps or services. </li><li>Familiarity with concepts, use cases, and user flows specific to subscriptions. </li><li>Experience documenting requirements shared across multiple apps. </li><li>Experience leading documentation review meetings—facilitating discussion, encouraging participation, taking meeting notes, logging action items related to the documentation, and following up with stakeholders on their action items. </li><li>3+ years of technical writing experience with complex apps, or an advanced degree in Technical Communication.<br /><br /></li></ul><strong>Pay & Benefits<br /><br /></strong>At Apple, base pay is one part of our total compensation package and is determined within a range. This provides the opportunity to progress as you grow and develop within a role. The base pay range for this role is between $112,500 and $231,700, and your base pay will depend on your skills, qualifications, experience, and location.<br /><br />Apple employees also have the opportunity to become an Apple shareholder through participation in Apple’s discretionary employee stock programs. Apple employees are eligible for discretionary restricted stock unit awards, and can purchase Apple stock at a discount if voluntarily participating in Apple’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan. You’ll also receive benefits including: Comprehensive medical and dental coverage, retirement benefits, a range of discounted products and free services, and for formal education related to advancing your career at Apple, reimbursement for certain educational expenses — including tuition. Additionally, this role might be eligible for discretionary bonuses or commission payments as well as relocation. Learn more about Apple Benefits.<br /><br />Note: Apple benefit, compensation and employee stock programs are subject to eligibility requirements and other terms of the applicable plan or program.<br /><br />Apple is an equal opportunity employer that is committed to inclusion and diversity.
