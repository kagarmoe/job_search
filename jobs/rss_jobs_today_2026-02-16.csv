What You'll Do Reporting to the Director of Documentation, as a Senior Technical Writer you will join the Docs Team to write documentation for CoreWeave's infrastructure offerings. You will partner closely with Product and Engineering teams who create our products to document product updates and try new functionality to build subject-matter expertise, and collaborate with Growth and Sales to drive updates on what features are most in demand for additional context and documentation, as well as Support and Solutions Architects to hear what customers are experiencing during product interactions. About The Role Prioritize and execute on docs projects. Roll out new product docs, tutorials and guides, example scripts, generated reference docs, and rework existing content to keep it fresh, relevant, and engaging. Use the product.

Run example scripts, and collaborate on new scripts to be included in guides. Regularly aggregate feedback. Capture perspectives from external users and internal team members. Collaborate with Support, Customer Success, Growth, and internal practitioners, such as Solutions Architects. Advocate for clarity and concision.

You've written API and product documentation for software developers, data scientists, or machine learning practitioners as your primary job for at least a decade. Scripting expertise. You'll spend a lot of time writing scripts that drive product interactions and generate documentation - whether that's writing code that ingests raw reference materials and makes it suitable for publishing, generating the perfect YAML file for Kubernetes to apply to a large cluster, or API use to call LLMs to do even more transformative and interesting content work.

Here are a few qualities we've found compatible with our team. If some of this describes you, we'd love to talk. Scrappy mindset. You'll be moving quickly to get updates into the docs, ship small incremental improvements continuously, and quickly measure the results of changes. Ownership mindset. Ability to own large-scoped projects that involve multiple stakeholders. Experience creating and documenting best practices for our team. Outgoing and friendly: You'll love this role if you enjoy connecting with real users day to day, helping them solve issues and understand good patterns for using our tools. Day to day you'll be answering questions and requests with a kind, thoughtful tone that makes users feel appreciated and connected to our team. Autonomous: If you work well in a self-directed environment, and proactively find ways to improve processes and collaborate with team members or engaged users, your initiative will really shine in this role. Curious and driven: Explore machine learning and learn more about the engineering stack and common ML workflows. Solve problems in both fast-paced, short term sprints and in larger, more long-term projects. Organized: You'll be organizing feedback from many channels into a single, orderly stream. Your organization skills and time management will be key to running this process well. Why CoreWeave? About At CoreWeave, we work hard, have fun, and move fast!

Ability to create and follow a documentation schedule. You must be able to accurately estimate how long it will take to reach milestones, meet the deadlines you set for yourself, and communicate changes well in advance, should deadlines need to change. Understand the software development life cycle. Work with minimal direction toward predetermined goals, and be able to quickly become proficient with new tools and apps. Independently anticipate and resolve problems in a fast-paced environment. BS/BA degree required in Technical Writing, Professional Writing, English, Communication, Computer Science, Engineering, Journalism, or other related field. Love technical writing! Preferred Qualifications Experience writing use cases, requirements specifications, or user flows. Experience writing copy for user interfaces (UX writing). Experience working on or writing about subscription-based apps or services. Familiarity with concepts, use cases, and user flows specific to subscriptions. Experience documenting requirements shared across multiple apps. Experience leading documentation review meetings-facilitating discussion, encouraging participation, taking meeting notes, logging action items related to the documentation, and following up with stakeholders on their action items. 3+ years of technical writing experience with complex apps, or an advanced degree in Technical Communication.

"Pratt & Whitney hiring Lead Ontology & Knowledge Engineer (Remote) in Hartford, CT",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/lead-ontology-knowledge-engineer-remote-at-pratt-whitney-4363702476,"Date Posted: 2026-01-15 Country: United States of America Location: US-CT-REMOTE Position Role Type: Remote U.S. Citizen, U.S. Person, or Immigration Status Requirements: U.S. citizenship is required, as only U.S. citizens are authorized to access information under this program/contract. Security Clearance: None/Not Required Pratt & Whitney is working to once again transform the future of flight - designing, building and servicing engines unlike any the world has ever seen. And because transformation begins from within, we're seeking the people to drive it. So, calling all curious. Come ready to explore and you'll find a place where your talent takes flight-beyond the borders of title, a country or your comfort zone. Bring your passion and commitment and we'll welcome you into a tight-knit team that takes our mission personally. Channel your drive to make a difference into shaping an organization and an industry that's evolving fast to the future. At Pratt & Whitney, the difference you make is on display every day. Just look up. Are you ready to go beyond? Pratt & Whitney digital technology has an exciting new opportunity for a Lead Ontology & Knowledge Engineer. What You Will Do: You aren't just building a database; you are teaching machines how to think about our business. You are the architect of the logic that powers our digital workforce. As the Lead Ontology & Knowledge Engineer, you will bridge the gap between structured/unstructured enterprise data and our LLM-powered agents. You will design, implement, and maintain the ontologies that serve as the ""ground truth"" for Pratt and Whitney. You will move us beyond simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) toward GraphRAG, enabling our agents to perform multi-hop reasoning and causal analysis. The Mission We are building the central nervous system for AI at Pratt & Whitney. Our goal is not just to manage data, but to deploy autonomous AI agents capable of complex reasoning, decision support, and automation. To achieve this, we need a Lead Ontology & Knowledge Engineer to construct the semantic layer, the Knowledge Graph, that gives our agents the context they need to understand the relationship between a specific engine part, a maintenance schedule, and a supply chain constraint. Key Responsibilities Ontology & Schema Design Develop and maintain enterprise-grade ontologies (OWL/RDF) that model the complex domain of aerospace engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain. Define the semantic schema for AI Agents, ensuring they share a common vocabulary when communicating across different business units (e.g., ensuring a ""Task"" in Engineering means the same thing to an agent in Operations). Knowledge Graph Implementation Lead the architecture and deployment of our Enterprise Knowledge Graph Build data pipelines (Python) to ingest data from legacy ERP systems, PLM software, and unstructured documents into the graph. Implement Entity Resolution and linking strategies to unify disparate data points across the organization. Context Engineering for AI Agents Collaborate with AI Engineers to design ""Context Windows"" for LLMs. You will determine what graph data needs to be injected into a prompt to maximize agent accuracy. Work on Causal Inference models: Structure data to help agents distinguish between correlation and causation (e.g., Did the maintenance delay cause the part failure, or did the part failure cause the delay?). Governance & Standards Establish semantic standards and data governance policies for the AI ecosystem. Evangelize the use of Knowledge Graphs within Pratt & Whitney, training other developers on graph-based thinking. Qualifications You Must Have: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Information Science, Mathematics, or related field with 10+ years of relevant experience; OR a Master's degree with 8+ years of relevant experience; OR a PhD in Computer Science, Information Science, Mathematics, or related field with 5+ years of relevant experience. Experience: 5+ years in Ontology Engineering, Knowledge Representation, or Data Modeling. Technical Stack: Proficiency in Graph Query Languages (SPARQL, Cypher, Gremlin). Strong coding skills in Python (essential for our AI stack). Experience with semantic web standards (RDF, OWL, SKOS, SHACL). AI Integration: Experience working with LLMs, Vector Databases, and RAG architectures. Domain Knowledge: Experience in manufacturing, aerospace, or complex supply chain environments is a strong plus. U.S. citizenship is required, as only U.S. citizens are authorized to access information under this program/contract.
