## Summary

I am a senior technical writer who specializes in documenting complex infrastructure, with a focus on security, cryptography, payments, and identity systems. I work most effectively in high-ambiguity environments where clarity, correctness, and sound structure matter as much as speed.

My background spans cryptographic infrastructure, regulated systems, and large technical ecosystems, including extensive work at AWS across internal and public-facing documentation. I am particularly strong in information architecture, taxonomy design, and content governance for complex domains, and I have led large-scale documentation audits and restructures to improve discoverability and long-term maintainability.

Earlier in my career, I trained as a historian and librarian, which shaped how I approach technical work. That foundation gives me a solid foundation in rapid domain acquisition, analytical reading, and organizing complex bodies of information into durable, navigable systems. I bring those skills directly to modern technical problems, from security documentation to AI-assisted authoring workflows.

I am motivated by work that treats documentation as infrastructure: something that must be precise, resilient, and designed to scale alongside the systems it describes.

## Experience

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

**Senior Technical Writer**
October 2022 - January 2026 (3 years 4 months)
Seattle, Washington, United States

At AWS, I documented cryptographic and identity infrastructure used in regulated and high-assurance environments, with a focus on key management, signing, encryption, and trust boundaries. I began in the Protocols, Libraries & Algorithms group, where I documented cryptographic libraries, Cryptographic Computing, and internal FIPS-related material, building a deep foundation in applied cryptography.

I later supported public-facing documentation for services including AWS Secrets Manager, Key Management Service, Payment Cryptography, CloudHSM, Certificate Manager, and Private Certificate Authority. While I did not work directly on blockchain protocols, my work centered on the same primitives that underpin Web3 systems: key custody, transaction signing, certificate-based trust, hardware-backed security, and compliance-aware cryptography.

In parallel, I led taxonomy and information architecture work for cryptography and technical content teams, designing durable structures for complex, evolving systems. I also built AI-assisted editing tools to enforce clarity, correctness, and consistency at scale.

### Tecton

**Sr. Technical Writer**
December 2016 - April 2021 (4 years 5 months)
Seattle, Washington

I led the project to consolidate product documentation from several microsites into a single website while continuing to maintain the documentation source files in separate GitHub repositories. Leading this project involved communicating priorities with team members, coordinating teamwork, and communicating our processes and objectives to stakeholders and the broader organization. The consolidated site is easy to navigate, features a federated search, and relies on automation for much of the reference material—ensuring that it is always current, correct, and complete.
